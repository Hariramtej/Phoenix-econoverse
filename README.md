This is the initial commit for the Vue.js setup

i forgot to save our old readme file so if you have it can you
add important info from here and push it to our repository?


### Refer to this guide to setup the environment on your local machine:
```
https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start
```

i think you can directly clone this repo and then just run it with node,
dont create a new vue project

Meanwhile these are the main commands that is common to all:
```
$ cd <your-project-name>
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
